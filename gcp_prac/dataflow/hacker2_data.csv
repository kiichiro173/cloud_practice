I think the OP exhibits some toxic mindsets.<p>&gt; As a final station, I&#x27;d like to describe what online freelancer markets look like for people like me. On freelancer.com and oDesk, you compete with hundreds of lowest-wage programmers from third world countries for exceedingly crappy &quot;projects&quot;. It&#x27;s an unmitigated race to the bottom.<p>Why does the OP feel entitled to not have to compete with others? Why should he be given a &quot;not crappy&quot; job? Because you were born in the US?<p>Fuck that attitude. Here&#x27;s what happened. The OP stagnated, and other parts of the world didn&#x27;t. Being from a first world country does not make you special. And it no longer shields you from the brutal realities that most of the world goes through with respect to human competition.<p>&gt; Maybe even more alarming, the nature of these jobs has changed, too. A year ago, you could sell some landing pages and some basic web programming. Today, almost every inquiry you get is for some illicit script to scrape social media sites.<p>Yes, the world moves on, the nature of work changes, and things that were valuable 10 years ago become commodities. Being a programmer means being able to program many different things; you know how demands are changing, so either adapt or die. Or switch what field you work in.

Maybe something will turn up.<p>No, don&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s the same shit that isn&#x27;t working for you. Go to some meetups, conferences, hackathons, etc. Take a part-time job doing something else to be able to afford the time to build the connections you see as being so important. Buy books and read tutorials (and build side projects) regarding new technologies you want&#x2F;need to learn. Hey I&#x27;m not saying this is the best plan, but any plan is better than no plan.<p>Or are &quot;connections&quot; your way of excusing your ego for slumping in life?

Yes, I&#x27;ve read all the memos and watched all the videos, including this one when I knew Dart wasn&#x27;t going to make it into Chrome for the first time. I knew it by Blink engineering lead Darin Fischer&#x27;s reaction when asked about Dart [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TlJob8K_OwE"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TlJob8K_OwE</a> at 17:25] To me it looked like he laughed and sort of scoffed, then he and another member talked Dart down. Maybe it is a failing of mine to look at emotional content when considering issues, but doing so sometimes imparts useful information.<p>At one point I was passionate about Dart because I thought it hit the sweet spot between JavaScript and Java applets in the browser with optional typing and generics. It turns out TypeScript hit that spot well enough and Anders was right about that.<p>I understand your frustrations about opportunity costs and lost effort that could have gone into JavaScript, but there is another possibility -- and this is just my opinion, which I voiced at the time -- that the Dart team was more focused on Dart on the server as a Java replacement. This was at a time when Oracle&#x27;s lawsuit with Google over the Java interfaces was a big question. I thought Dart might be a plan B on the server and why Dart2js was not getting the attention I thought it deserved.<p>The JavaScript output on the client was unreadable, very large and much of the disdain for Dart from JavaScript devs was for this reason (17000 lines for a &quot;hello world&quot; if I recall correctly - I am not a systems guy but isn&#x27;t most of that the DartVM translated to JS. Couldn&#x27;t it be compiled to asm.js and loaded ahead of time if so desired?)<p>I think we agree on most of this and I apologize. It wasn&#x27;t my intention to offend you. Dart still has a chance if they can get the translator to ES6 to work, and I don&#x27;t see why not, so I hope to use Dart when and where it makes sense.",9993007,,,,9998905,

Once the shares are sold, the company no longer owns them, so whatever happens, happens, just like whenever you sell anything else.  If a farmer sells some corn, and the price drops drastically afterwards, it makes no difference to the farmer.<p>However, the owners of the company might get together and force the board of directors to do something, like fire the CEO.  The CEO, who probably has a lot of compensation as stock or options, would like price to be higher, so he is likely to take actions to get the stock price higher.

Sure the consumer is probably never going to experience a failure irrespective of whether the buy a seagate or WD drive - but that&#x27;s not the point - the point is that the long tail of the distribution, WD and Fujitsu beat Seagate for reliability.

There is a very critical distinction between a library&#x2F;module and a command-line wrapper. Your programming language probably has a module that exposes the imagemagick API. However, this doesn&#x27;t mean that it uses shell commands for anything; it just exposes the functions to your programming language of choice.<p>I wrote the backend and processing system for a website[1] that deals with converting files, and incidentally uses imagemagick and ffmpeg, amongst other things. You&#x27;ll notice that everything that that calls external programs is handled very carefully. One example of this careful handling is that all of the commands that can be executed are in a single file[2], and very easy to think about. Compare that to OP&#x27;s software, where there are multiple commands scattered across different files.

The hope was that people in the predominantly Russian-speaking Eastern regions would eventually &quot;convert&quot; politically to a pro-European direction because a primary driver of the pro-Russian leanings (other than cultural factors) was a positive memory of industrialization by the USSR which brought them jobs and a better way of life. The idea was that the older generation who remembered the glory of the USSR would eventually become replaced with a less Russia-centric one.

However this is no issue.  As a friend of mine always likes to say, trade is like technology: you can think of other countries like a machine where you put in one kind of good (exports) and get back another (imports).  So why would you want to impose a special tax on this machine?  Economic theory suggests that to do so would be inefficient.<p>The only valid reason for protectionism is strategic: e.g. having the ability to make things for yourself in case other countries cut off supply.

&quot;Is there value in Bitcoin? Let me ask a counter question: Is decentralization valuable? If you think that we&#x27;ll increasingly lose trust in the central authorities that manage the infrastructure we rely on, you might expect Bitcoins to rise a lot in value. If not, that is you believe that authorities will be able to tackle the challenges of the future better in centralized form, then from your perspective Bitcoins don&#x27;t add value.

michaelochurch,,1397932674,,comment,,"<i>This is in stark contrast to the trend of lumping both sick time and time off into a single limited “PTO” bucket. Having an unlimited budget of time off means you don’t have to worry about “banking” time in case you get sick.</i><p>Those policies are fucked-up. It&#x27;s Enron-style accounting, a way for a company to say, &quot;we offer 15 days off&quot; while lying through its fucking teeth. Counting sick days against vacation is evil. By effectively forcing people to come into work when ill and making the whole office sick, they&#x27;re fucking with <i>my</i> health (and everyone&#x27;s, most of all the people who are already sick and deserve rest).<p>Companies that have that pooled &quot;PTO&quot; bucket end up with people getting more colds because sick people come in to work. So, even though people are in the office more days, nothing gets done all winter. Like most mean-spirited HR policies, the bulk effect on productivity is negative, but it enables HR douches to look like they&#x27;re saving money while externalizing costs to the rest of the company.<p>Whoever came up with that &quot;innovation&quot; deserves to be sold into Roose Bolton&#x27;s captivity.<p><i>If unseen opportunities or obligations come up – invited to speak abroad?</i><p>Companies that expect people to count conferences against vacation time should be burned to the ground. (Figuratively speaking, of course, or literally but only at 2:30 am when no one is in the building.) Professional development is <i>part of the fucking job</i>, assholes. If you&#x27;re a scrappy startup and can&#x27;t pay for conferences, that&#x27;s one thing. Making people take vacation to go is just mean-spirited and horrible.<p>What there should be is:<p>(1) two week mandatory vacation, every year. Banks have this, to prevent repeats of the SocGen disaster.<p>(2) 4 weeks vacation. That should establish 4 weeks as &quot;the norm&quot;. If people need more, they can take time unpaid. If they use a little less, they can carry it over.<p>(3) sick time unlimited. If you suspect abuse, ask for a damn doctor&#x27;s note.<p>(4) no vacation penalty for conferences related to the job.<p>(5) no stigma against unpaid leave, which should be unlimited as long as it doesn&#x27;t directly hurt the company. (Obviously, the CEO can&#x27;t take 3 months off without pay.)<p>If there&#x27;s no stigma against unpaid leave, why is (2), the 4-week allocation, so important? First, because in reality, unpaid leave will always carry some stigma. So it&#x27;s better to set the &quot;official&quot; PTO at 4 weeks, rather than at 2 while paying 4% more. Second, because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any benefit to the company in someone working 50 vs. 48 weeks per year and so it doesn&#x27;t deserve to be compensated as a general principle. (I&#x27;m all for people being paid back for unused vacation when they leave, but I think that people should be discouraged from taking less than 4 weeks off per year.)",7613526,,,,7614249,

StillBored,,1397966639,,comment,,"I used delphi extensively in the mid 90&#x27;s, from the 1.0 release until about 2001. Those were probably some of the most enjoyable and productive times of my life.<p>IMHO, nothing comes close to the syntactic clarity of object Pascal. This has a ton of knock on effects for long term maintainability.<p>Plus, the early versions of the Delphi component model were insanely clear and well documented. My first delphi program was a reimplementation of a 6 month long (4 programmer) access database&#x2F;vb application. I completely reimplemented a 2 man year project in about 24 hours with it using little more than the help docs. After a quick demo at work on Monday, everyone pretty much agreed to kick MS Access&#x2F;vb to the curb and pick up my code base.<p>The data aware components were a life saver, and to this day programming in a wide range of languages I am constantly reminded how painful doing things that were simple 20 years ago is. It drives a fundamental distaste into my mouth every time I&#x27;m hacking an AJAX app to do basic sorting&#x2F;filtering of a simple result set. Usually doable with delphi in a matter of a few mouse clicks.<p>Plus, by the late &#x27;90s there were a ton of 3rd party component libraries that nailed just about every GUI interaction an average program might need. The integration of reporting components made generating nice paper printouts a snap too.<p>So, this is probably why its still being used. Reimplementing a delphi application of a hundred thousand lines is probably a thousand man year project with a &quot;modern&quot; web stack. And so, much like the mainframes running in the data centers of banks&#x2F;insurance&#x2F;etc companies, delphi is probably still driving a fair number of business logic applications. I know that some of the applications I wrote in the 90&#x27;s are still in use at government agencies.<p>BTW: I used BC builder too, and hated it even though I tend to like C++. The C++ syntax was simply to unwieldy vs pascal.<p>I have periodically tried out more recent version of delphi or lazurus <a href=""http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazarus.freepascal.org&#x2F;</a> and they don&#x27;t seem to be nearly as elegant as the early versions.

elohesra,,1398011078,,comment,,"Or, to play devil&#x27;s advocate, that you aren&#x27;t putting in the level of work in your day job that you could be putting in. If I were an employer looking at a candidate and I saw they had huge amounts of open source contributions, the first thing I&#x27;d ask is &quot;how did you have time for this and your day job?&quot;.<p>It also tells you something else about a candidate: that their previous job probably wasn&#x27;t particularly hard or that they didn&#x27;t have much in the way of responsibilities. If you&#x27;re the lead developer on a several hundred thousand line codebase, it seems less likely that you have time to build an open source resume than if you were a junior developer.<p>Honestly, I think open source is a bit of a mixed signal. If the code shown in the repositories is great, then that&#x27;s fantastic, but if it&#x27;s merely average then I think it makes you look worse than just not having it there at all. This is really my biggest objection with open source: if you want to use it as some sort of resume, then you have to contribute huge amounts of time to it in order to make it representative of your skill. Then it&#x27;s no longer an open source project you do for fun, but just a second day job. Additionally, when it gets good enough for an employer to see, what interviewer is going to have time to read through it? This problem is magnified especially when developers start treating open source as a form of resume, and interviewers have to wade through shockingly poor repositories from every candidate to determine the candidate&#x27;s quality.",7617105,,,,7617342,

If you&#x27;ve ever read a term sheet or a SPA, then you know that VCs have a huge incentive to encourage founders to increase the size of their option pools: your typical term sheet requires the existing shareholders to take the dilution of the option pool rather than the investors. Because of this, the bigger your option pool is the lower your price-per-share becomes, and as such the investor gets a bigger cut. It requires founders to budget their option pool up front and divvy it up carefully until the next round of funding. These terms ENCOURAGE founders to keep their option grants tight.<p>Sam Altman and others need to put their money where their mouths are - if you want bigger option pools for employees then remove this clause from your term sheets and encourage other investors to do the same. If you think that more employee equity is good for business, then give us more flexibility with the option pool and share the dilution with us.

The former, as you say, only tells you about the underlying representation. It says &quot;this is a float, so the computer should store it in such and such a way.&quot; That&#x27;s fine, but it doesn&#x27;t tell us enough.<p>The latter example is far more useful. In my imaginary language, the declaration implicitly tells the computer to store the value as a float, because the kilogram type has been defined as such elsewhere. But that&#x27;s not all it does! It tells us and the compiler that this float <i>represents a real-world quantity measured in kilograms.</i> It prevents us from mistakenly passing kilograms where a pounds were expected, or seconds where kilograms were expected.<p>On the Haskell front, you might be interested in the Dimensional library, which does just that. It also works elegantly with multiplying and dividing units. E.g. if you have a miles value and an hours value, you can divide to get a miles per hour value.",7621634,,,,7622193,

After 12 hour marathon coding sessions ‘typical entrepreneurs’ walk 10 metres from desk to bed and collapse in their shared accommodations. Living in such lean conditions makes those crucial first months of business far cheaper. This work ethic and minimial living costs maximises the runway before the seed money runs out.<p>Paul Graham is one of my favourite bloggers, and his essay entitled The Other Road Ahead he paints a clear picture of how lean a start-up can be, stating ""You can literally launch your product as three guys sitting in the living room of an apartment, and a server collocated at an ISP. We did.""<p>No matter how much I’d love to take the lean ramen noodle approach it’s simply not practical for me. I’m a father of two, a husband of one, and an employee. I’ve got a beautiful family with young children, a modest house with a mortgage, and a full-time job to pay the bills. In short, I have a standard existence that I imagine many of my readers share. Living off noodles in a cheap apartment with my co-founders is not the only way that start-ups are built.

The very nature of negative externalities is that they're <i>problems</i> that societies have to deal with when one entity decides to profit at the detriment of his neighbors.<p>Here's an example of ""negative externalities"" that is actually true, and took place near a town where I used to live.<p>Assume: You're a property owner, and you don't want Pig Farm, INC to buy the parcel next to you and put up a pig farm because of the smell, potential health problems due to the (literally) toxic waste, etc.  Yeah, there are regulations, but Pig Farm, INC has figured out that if it has a facility with 99 instead of 100 pigs that it can skirt the laws.<p>Problem:  Pig waste is toxic, and causes health problems that you're beginning to notice is affecting your children.
Root Cause:  There's a pig farm next door to your house.
Solution:  Move.  Or get the pig farm move.<p>Problem:  You were there first.  Why should you move?  Besides, you can't afford to move because you're behind on doctor bills resultant from the toxic pig farm emissions.
Root Cause:  Doctor bills coupled with the fact that nobody will buy your house because it's next to a pig farm.
Solution:  Take the loss on your house and move anyway;  health benefits outweigh the desire to hold on to your property in a place that is making you and your family sick.<p>Problem:  Pig Farm, INC bulldozes the house you used to live on and builds another facility, which conveniently holds 99 pigs.  What used to be just your problem is now your former neighbor's problem.<p>In summary, it's not about ""money for the solution""  it's about an ""equitable solution"".  If one farm in town is causing 95 percent of the town's health problems, and causing loss of equity to 98 percent of its residents, that's a good thing <i>only</i> for the CEO of Pig Farm, INC who's raking in the money with the increased salary due to demand for bacon and pork and sausage.",1124734,,,,1124822,

Some of my friends think that's silly, but it works for me... Finally, a small point, but one with some psychological validity: as I keep changing the notation to my own, I get a feeling of being creative, tiny but non-zero...""<p>And the part that reminded me of your advice:<p>""Learning a language is different from learning a mathematical subject; in one the problem is to acquire a habit, in the other to understand a structure. The difference has some important implications. In learning a language from a textbook, you might as well go through the book as it stands and work all the exercises in it; what matters is to keep practising the use of the language. If, however, you want to learn group theory, it is not a good idea to open a book on page 1 and read it, working all the problems in order, till you come to the last page. It's a bad idea. The material is arranged in the book so that its linear reading is logically defensible, to be sure, but we readers are human, all different from one another and from the author, and each of us is likely to find something difficult that is easy for someone else. My advice is to read till you come to a definition new to you, and then stop and try to think of examples and non-examples, or till you come to a theorem new to you, and then stop and try to understand it and prove it for yourself -- and, most important, when you come to an obstacle, a mysterious passage, an unsolvable problem, just skip it. Jump ahead, try the next problem, turn the page, go to the next chapter, or even abandon the book and start another one. Books may be linearly ordered, but our minds are not.""",1123637,,,,1124968,

My point was mostly that Warren Buffet in particular sometimes seems to over-simplify issues such as this one in a way that I think is specious, albeit while at the same time making him look super-populist and folksy.<p>Thanks for pointing out so many things in such an objective fashion without getting into any political rhetoric. I definitely agree that no matter which way you do it, pretty much any taxation scheme is going to be unfair from one perspective or another, and I largely concur on all the issues you bring up. That's why I hate to see Warren Buffet make these simplistic claims that people can rabidly latch on to, rather than a real discussion of the constraints and trade-offs involved like you've done.",1125401,,,,1125623,

timcash,,1266211055,,comment,,"Please provide some more background on why the project was created and the ultimate goal. Without that I do not really buy your argument as I have also worked with government contracts (including cost plus) and spent six year in the US Air Force.  The problems are these. (1) Did they really need this system in the first place? Example: The F22 Raptor a fifth generation multipurpose fighter. I would argue that we do not really need this system but, sadly the people I worked for (Air Force Generals) the guys who create the ideas and sign the contracts did not even think to ask that question. Building another fighter was a forgone conclusion to them. It was purely about building something and not about defending against a real threat or even a perceived future threat. To the guys who run the Air Force (former fighter pilots primarily) of coarse you need a new plane. (2) Are you building yet another proprietary system on top of other proprietary systems. Example: JSTARS or the E8-C built by Northrop. This system collects a bunch of data about movement on the ground. The problem is Northrop created a proprietary mechanism for getting the data off of the plane. So now the government has to buy the plane and the system to get the data. (3) Was there another way to solve the problem? Example: Microsoft Sharepoint. There are so many sharepoint sites setup in the DOD it is complete waste. Every single unit thinks they need a sharepoint site because other units have sharepoint sites. No one is bothering to ask; hey instead of all setting up our own site why dont we just create a big repository where everyone can drop there (docs, ppts, xls, pdfs, etc...) and tag them with the unit they are from. So I would ask did you need this emails system? Are you perpetuating the problem of continuing to build proprietary systems? Is there another way to accomplish this task outside of an email system? Why did you need t1 lines by the way? Now to the Hammer and the bolt example you give. Instead of building a new bolt for every project and then having to test it and build spares etc... build a bolt that can be used on many projects. I have been in these contract meetings. The private companies intentionally build as many one off solution as possible so we have no choice but, to keep coming back to them. You say build a company and bid on contracts. If you work in contracts you know it is not that simple. I would love to if I had some help navigating the bureaucracy... Again give some more background on that project if you can.",1125826,,,,1125942,
patio11,,1266211809,,comment,,"<i>Every time someone checks something, the result is far less than originally claimed.</i><p>Statements like this make us look like rabid partisans who are incapable of acknowledging that any actual science is occurring, and will be used to dismiss us when we make claims which are factually well-founded.  Let's keep to claims which we can make which are well-supported by the evidence: there is significant scientific uncertainty about the degree to which global warming is anthropogenic, the ""consensus"" has been oversold, the rigorous system of checks that we have been told existed has repeatedly failed in ways both subtle and obvious, and the costs of measures designed to address global warming are unknown but acknowledged to be very, very high.<p>Incidentally, I would soft peddle one fact that I know but believe is inadvisable to say too loudly right now: the process of global warming science has been systematically compromised by politically motivated fraud.  Twelve months ago, saying that around me would have drawn the same rebuke as above: don't say that, we don't have evidence for it, let's stick to what we can demonstrate.  Then the ""Climategate"" emails came out.  I don't care who you are or where you stand on this issue, threatening to destroy evidence to avoid it falling into the hands of researchers immediately pushes us waaaaaaaay into the ""fraud"" category.  However, in terms of marketing, I'd say softpeddle that factually justifiable conclusion until we've shaken the apple tree a little more, and can present it as part of the pattern of behavior it appears to be, rather than ""a regrettable incident from a single overworked, much put-upon scientist who might have contributed a few lines to a report which is 99.99% good science.""<p>Sadly, we're not likely to get any help from the U.S. mainstream media in shaking the apple tree, at least until I can think of a good hook for why climate fraud is Dubya's fault.

when you write 'A lot of the more pedantic REST advocates' you make it seem as if there was a choice to be 'strict REST' or 'less pedantic REST'. The problem with that is as follows: REST is an architectural style, which means that it consists of a set of constraints it imposes on an architecture. The benefit is that such constraints induce a set of system properties (e.g. cacheability, scalability). Usually, the choice for an architecture means that you are interested in your system having these properties.
Now, if you drop constraints at will, you modify the style and do not get the desired system properties.
The notion of 'non pedantic REST' (or 'Low REST') is missing the point.",1122342,,,,1126253,

wkimeria,,1423796321,,comment,,"I think saying that cars are limited to the citys elites is overstating the case a bit. There are quite a few middle class families with cars. The problem is twofold<p>1: The collapse of the public bus system (KBS or Kenya Bus Service) in the early 90s 
2: The lack of any investment in infrastructure since at least the 70s. There are a bunch of reasons (IMF structural adjustment, corruption, poor planning etc)<p>I&#x27;m kenyan and remember that in the 80s it was relatively quick for me to get to downtown Nairobi, or to School (for anyone who knows Nairobi, I was commuting from South B to Nairobi Primary School). I could either have my parents drop me (they worekd in the CBD and drove there), take a bus to downtown Nairobi and walk to school from there or take another bus to school (I used to opt to walk the 2nd leg and buy these really terrible SciFi books &#x27;Perry Rhodhan&#x27; that were translated to English from German, but thats another story...).<p>In 1980, the bus&#x2F;matatu ride from South B to Downtown Nairobi (near Standard Chatered bank) took about 10-12 minutes. The last time I did this (in 2010, I needed to get from South B to the National Archives in the CBD so I hopped a #11 Matatu), it took 2 hours, and that was not in rush hour traffic. I could have gotten out and walked there faster (and regularly used to do so in the 80s, but everything is fenced off and over-built). The next day I drove with my mum and same thing (South B to Kariokor), there is literally no way of avoiding spending a large amount of your life sitting in traffic, and it boggles my mind that there are cities that are worse (i.e mexico City)<p>There are simply too many cars for the infrastructure. And in a really bone-headed move, some time ago the government decided to solve this problem by banning public service vehicles (buses and matatus) from the Central Business District, but private cars were allowed. Of course this was so the rich could travel un-impeded. The plan didn&#x27;t last due to the outcry, but that shows you the priorities of the politicians.<p>But if it meets its promise, this app would be truly amazing and useful.

As such <i>the off diagonal elements of the payoff matrix are irrelevant to any rational decision making because any two rational actors with the same goal will always make the same choice in the same situation</i>. To do anything else would be irrational.<p>So within the frame of the theory both players know <i>with certainty</i> that because the game is being played by maximizing rational actors that <i>the other player will always do exactly what they do</i>. This is true no matter what they do: the other player will always reach the same conclusion. Rationality dictates it, if rationality means anything at all.<p>It is only when you smuggle in the possibility of an irrational choice on the part of one of the players that the off-diagonal elements become relevant, because one player can for unaccountable reasons choose to do something irrational, which a maximizing rational actor would never do.<p>Game theory is not about people. It&#x27;s about rational actors who want to maximize their payoff. For such entities there is no dilemma, since only the diagonal elements of the matrix matter, and cooperation is the obvious maximizing strategy.<p>Unfortunately, game theory under this constraint becomes very boring.

Cass,,1423913148,,comment,,"&lt;em&gt;Animals and children running out last-second into the road?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;<p>I feel like AI would outperform the heck out of us in that situation, because solving it correctly involves a) high situational awareness, which we suck at because we get distracted, and b) making split-second calculations, which we suck at because we panic and our reflexes aren&#x27;t that fast. I mean, this is a simple situation, when it comes down to it:<p>Something runs out into the road.<p>- Can you swerve and avoid hitting it without hitting anything else or driving off the road? If yes, do. If no:<p>- Can you hit the brakes without endangering anyone behind you? (Humans tend to have trouble with this decision, because half the time we forget to watch the rear view mirror and now there&#x27;s no time to check. An AI would ALWAYS know what was behind it.)
If yes, do. If not:<p>Are you more worried about endangering the thing before you or the thing behind you? If it&#x27;s an animal, hit the animal. If the thing in front of you is a squishy human and the thing behind you is a car protected by all the engineering that protects cars in crashes these days, hit the brakes.<p>That&#x27;s all there is to it, 99 % of the time. Sure, this is a situation where AI might make the wrong decision in 1 % of cases, but it&#x27;s also a situation where humans are wrong <i>much more than that.</i><p>&lt;em&gt;How do you deal with a lack of markers on the road?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;<p>This one is actually probably most easily solved by just putting markers on all roads. Sure, that would require driving down <i>all roads</i> in a specially-engineered expensive vehicle with a dedicated crew, so you think it sounds like unaffordable insanity until you realize <i>google has already done it once</i>, for the googlemaps mapping project. Just do it again, this time in a car made for spray-painting markers instead of mapping stuff.<p>Apart from that, the overwhelming majority of problems on the road can be solved by yielding even when you&#x27;re technically in the right and just slowing the heck down, if necessary to walking speed and below. There will still be problems that only a human being can solve, but there&#x27;s going to be a human being in the car, so worst case, pull over and ask them. If your human is drunk or underage, pull over, wait for the next passing car, watch how their human solves it, and do what they did. In the rare case where there&#x27;s no other car likely to pass any time soon and the human in the car is incapacitated - possibly some sort of remote solution would work, where a human in some kind of remote driving center can take control of your car for a minute if necessary?<p>There&#x27;ll still be high-speed situations where the AI will fuck and kill someone, but I do think people would come to accept self-driving AI <i>even if it occasionally fucks up and kills people</i>, because it&#x27;ll be world-changingly convenient. And so far we&#x27;ve accepted a LOT of occasionally-deadly shit if it&#x27;s sufficiently convenient. (Trains. planes. Nuclear reactors. Every single one of those things had waves of protests and people going &quot;It will never work, and when it fails, people will die!

He's an entrepreneur who sells machine tools via paper catalog and his website.  It's truly fascinating to meet with him every few months and just talk business, family, life, all that stuff.<p>He has this hypothesis that one of the primary reason for American innovative dominance is due to the ubiquity of <i>basements</i> in America. His theory goes that while much of the rest of the 1st world countries are very crowded in the cities, America has room such that even folks who live in the cities have basements.<p>Basements being where the majority of the ""tinkering"" is done, because you don't have to leave home to go work on your pet project. Because basements aren't as ""livable"" as the rest of the house, they are usually relegated to work benches, mini-offices, and the less-sightly kind of things you wouldn't want sitting out in your living room or cluttering up your closets. And they're as big as the house - so plenty of space to work with.<p>Because just about everyone has basements, everyone has convenient access to a private working sanctuary to attempt to live out their dreams.<p>So that's basically how his hypothesis goes.

People hired out of college would be making $45,000 a year, while people that had been at the company for a few years and hired away from a well-paying job would be making $150,000 a year.

There's then plenty of leeway to pay your H1Bs $60,000 a year, which is a rather low programmer's salary, while still paying <i>some</i> Americans less.<p>I think the key loophole is that you have to pay a certain average amount based on region and job code, but that region includes the suburbs and rural areas and the job code includes all of ""senior architect"" and ""test engineer intern"".  So you can pay someone a ""suburbs"" salary instead of a city salary, and pay them a non-financial-services-firm salary even though they work for an investment bank, and then pay them like the lowest-level ""computer programmer"" American regardless of their job responsibilities.<p>Anyway, if my previous employer's goal was to attract the best talent by paying great salaries, they failed.

That message is a tipoff that the book is sold under the agency model, where the publisher sets the price and Amazon takes a cut off the top.  Under the agency rules, Amazon had no choice but to sell at that price.<p>HarperCollins, the publisher of this book, was one of the three publishers that settled with the DoJ in the lawsuit that accused the publishers of colluding with Apple to use the agency model to impose price-fixing on ebooks.  As part of the settlement they agreed to knock it off. [1]  But obviously the DoJ does not have jurisdiction outside the USA, so they presumably would still be free to force that model elsewhere.<p>Tim Bray is based in Canada, so if he's logged in Amazon presumably would treat it as a Canadian sale, and still sell the book under the agency pricing?<p>edit to add: I tried going to Amazon.ca to see what they'd show a US-based customer, but they don't seem to show me Kindle versions of that book at all.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/06/apple-ebooks-idUSL2E8K6GI720120906"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/06/apple-ebooks-idUSL...</a>",4668416,,,,4668829,

mpk,,1233796624,,comment,,"Whether or not working from home is good or not really depends on your situation.<p>I have a 40 minute commute to and from work which I use to read the papers or a book. I have an official 'work-from-home' day (Wednesday) and the option to work from home other days if there's nothing at the office that requires my attention.<p>However, I usually just go in to the office every Wednesday and only sometimes use the work-from-home-any-day option.<p>I happen to like the work environment we have. I have a nice clean office space with a big desk, two large monitors, good lighting, a comfortable chair, a kitchen with food and drinks, a rec room with couches and a pool table and whiteboards everywhere.<p>I am frequently interrupted, but half the time it's by fellow coders working on different problems who want to bounce some ideas off of me. There's an unwritten protocol for programmers interrupting programmers where I work. You walk by and say 'hey'. You get a 'hey' back and if the programmer doesn't turn back to the monitor, they're usually open for interruption. Or they might suck you into whatever problem they're working on.. :)<p>The other half of the interruptions are from the operations, business, sales and management side. These can be very annoying and consume a lot of time, but I encourage them (up to a point). For one, they provide a good finger on the pulse of the wider company operations. They keep a level of transparency between software development and the other areas of the company. They're also good for social cohesion (a 'we' feeling as opposed to 'us and them').<p>Interaction just works better face-to-face. The pool table we have, for example, is rarely used for actual games. Usually it's used by two or three people that are discussing something and just making a few shots while doing it. Or just goofing off for a bit.<p>Of course, I also have to get some code done. I can manage my time and do this, but I also have a lot of freedom in this respect. If you're working with a boss who micro-manages you, eh.. well .. that's a different story.

jandrewrogers,,1350610873,,comment,,"I can confirm that offering good health insurance is an important part of compensation when hiring, particularly for older candidates. At my startup, a generous health benefit was implemented early on in an effort to attract more senior employees. Often people in their 20s find it less valuable.<p>Health insurance tied to employment is a bad idea generally but that is the state of USian reality and so we make the best of that. Employer-based health insurance was a side effect of government regulation during the second World War that lingered long after the regulation has disappeared.<p>As a practical matter, the ACA is unlikely to help. The net effect is that it seems to be increasing overall costs per employee to maintain the status quo, and there are costs down the road that have not even been implemented yet. A company like mine can hide the cost but I can see why it would be problematic for businesses that are sensitive to total employee costs. As long as businesses are paying for health insurance, the math of the ACA is pretty grim; all it did was move the costs around and add some new ones. It is disappointing that it sort of ended up being the worst of both worlds.",4671796,,,,4671923,

This might be true, but I think people are going to remember this. Maybe it would work, because I could see Path just re-branding into a more intimate version of twitter, but only time will tell. For the most part, I think Path shot themselves in the foot pretty fucking well.",5656673,,,,5656938,

If you actually mean <i>in Silicon Valley itself,</i> then it's difficult to get around without a car (although not impossible, especially if you have a bike and both live and work within sane biking distance of a light rail station).<p>But our current dotcom boom is different from the 1999 boom in one significant respect--a much higher proportion of the action is happening in San Francisco. If you can manage to live in SF itself, Oakland, Alameda, Berkeley, Daly City, or arguably even certain neighborhoods in cities on the peninsula, you may be able to get along very well without a car. I have several friends who don't have any issue without one. (I live in Santa Clara and could actually <i>probably</i> manage without a car given my specific neighborhood--even though I go into an office in San Francisco once or twice a week--but I wouldn't enjoy it.)<p>The costs certainly <i>are</i> insane, which is really the biggest problem I have here; I'm a middle-aged guy who still lives a lot like a college student: renting an apartment with a roommate.

emn13,,1367829541,,comment,,"Logging is not a panacea.<p>It's easy to swamp useful messages in tons of noise, so just logging whatever is not necessarily an improvement.  Logging means code, and more code means more work, less readability, and more bugs.  In particular, logging somewhere, sometime means I/O, which opens up a whole new class of bugs you'd rather avoid.  For instance, I've seen several systems go down simply because the disk space ran out.<p>Logging is also slow - his example of finding a cheapest path is a good example of this.  These are well-studied algorithms that explore huge state spaces.  Adding logging as he suggests can easily mean the application's running time is spent almost entirely logging.  This might not be an issue: maybe you don't need this very often, or maybe the path's aren't very complex, so you can get away with huge overhead because systems are so fast anyhow.  But often as not, you can't.  And even when you can, you might be adding a trivial DoS vector for your app, or you might be needlessly limiting its applicablity.<p>If you have an error, it's nice to log whatever you can to help understand it.  But the benefit of understanding the odd error more easily needs to be weighed against the non-trivial costs in time, readability, maintainability, disk space and runtime, particularly if you're pre-emptively logging before an error ever occors.",5661228,,,,5661415,

jerf,,1239933287,,comment,,"It's just as skewed a perspective to look only at the negatives as it is to only consider the positives.<p>Science and engineering may not be the paths to easy street, but at least there's some sort of perfectly rational story as to how an engineer can get paid: Someone pays the engineer to make stuff, and make stuff better, then sells the stuff. Engineers can actually expand the economy, with new resources, new things to do with those resources, better ways to use those resources, and so on. Yes, there's up-and-coming competition, but it's not as if we're going into that competition empty handed or as if the other side is populated with some sort of superhumans or something (yet); it's just <i>competition</i>. Cry about it if you must, but then get back to work.<p>For those with humanities degrees, and especially the PhDs we're really talking about in the context of this story, they are, not to put too fine a point on it, luxuries. Expenditures. Ones we're a bit overstocked on, too. And they do <i>not</i> grow the economy, their sustenance comes from producers.<p>This is not intrinsically bad. We have humanities PhDs in general for good reasons. I am not trying to draw intrinsic ""goodness"" judgments from this point, because that depends too much on your personal definition of goodness. The point I <i>am</i> trying to draw is that going into science and engineering in general is going to be a stronger bet over time, because you're much closer to the parts of the economy that generate economic value. The humanities majors are at the end of a much longer chain, with every middleman taking their cut, and too many of them trying to drink from the same hose. And what they generate may be valuable to humanity, but... it's hard to eat a thesis on the philosophical similarities between Marxist dialectic and Dingbellian Hypertrophisms as manifested in the movie Titanic. And that's before we talk about ""oversupply"", which drives the economic value of such things even lower.<p>I don't think science and engineering are particularly ""increasing"" in risk; they've never been perfectly safe and they continue to not be perfectly safe; I'm unconvinced the magnitude has changed much, it's just the delusions of safety have been replaced by reality. Humanities is at increasing risk, because in a contraction they're really, really easy to cut off, especially when there's more than we need. And contractions happen.<p>(Remember, as raw and as rough as it may sound, <i>nothing</i> is perfectly safe. When something is portrayed as perfectly safe, <i>run screaming</i>. Someone is either lying to you, or deluded, and neither is good. Engineering and science are as good a bet as you're going to find over the next 25 years, but in general, the closer you can get to generating value the better.
